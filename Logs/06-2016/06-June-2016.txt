-> Task: Preparing the questionnaire questions

	commencing @ 23.58 pm
	finished   @ 00.26 am

General ideas for questions:

1. Provide options to choose for participants, divided into 'Researcher' and 'Clinician'

2. Their position title (e.g. senior, junior, associate) of their role in their line of work (?)

3. 'Experience in the field of CA', display by range of number, no 'overlap'

4.a. Provide a list of haemodynamic properties (?) and ask the respondents to rank it

5.a. Provide a list of visualisation tool use in the field of CA and ask the respondents to rating it
