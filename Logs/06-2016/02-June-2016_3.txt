Key takeaways:

--> Tips and tricks to help you ensure you are developing a good survey questionnaire:

1) Clearly state your intentions within the research.
2) Include instructions with your survey questionnaire.
3) Don't ask for personal information unless you need it.
4) Keep the questions short and concise.
5) Ask only one question at a time (avoid 'the double-barreled question').
6) Make sure the questions are unbiased.
7) Ask questions that can be answered by your subjects.
8) Order/group questions according to subject.
9) Present the questions in a clean and organised layout.
10) Test the survey questionnaire.


To do next: 'List all of the objectives and the expected outcome of the questionnaire'
