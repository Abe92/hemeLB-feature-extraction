This note is focus on the 'Unstructured questions'

.> Unstructure questions, are questions where there is no list of answer choices
from which to choose. Respondents are simply asked to write their response to a
question.

.> Unstructured questions is best use when you are exploring new ideas and you
don't really know what to expect from respondents. In some situations, you may
have a partial list of answer choices, but you may still have some doubts or 
uncertainty about other possible responses.

--> Key takeaways:

1) Open-ended questions let you get more insight into the respondents'thoughts and
ideas about a subject. 

2) Open-ended questions are useful when you are trying to capture new ideas or
information for which you have no basis to develop an all inclusive set of
structured responses.

3) The disadvantages to using open-ended questions is that it can be much more time
consuming and difficult to analyse the data. In general you should try to minimise
the number of open-ended questions in your survey questionnaire.
