-> Task: Create the building blocks for Machine Learning

	commencing @ 10.00 am BST
	finished   @ 12.41 pm BST
	
achieved: 
	(1) Read, practise and understand the code
	    template to perform machine learning for
	    logistic regression
	    
	(2) Build the basic foundation of the code
	
to-do now:
	(1) Lunch break + napping
	
to-do next:
	(1) Continue writing the methodologies chapter
	(2) Calculate the velocity magnitude of the
	    hemeLB output file. The files that need
	    to be calculated is:
	    - hemeLB_train.csv
	    - hemeLB_test.csv
	    

-> Task: Finish writing the methodologies chapter

	commencing @ ~14.30 pm BST
	finished   @ 18.32 pm BST
	
achieved: 	
	(1) Chapter 2 (Methodologies) is complete
	
cancelled:
	(1)Calculate the velocity magnitude of the
	    hemeLB output file. The files that need
	    to be calculated is:
	    - hemeLB_train.csv
	    - hemeLB_test.csv
	    
to-do next: 
	(1) Tomorrow the cancelled objective
	    should be completed
	(2) Determine my own classification
	    for whether it is
	    - Bulging (1)
	    - Not bulging (0)
	    from exploring the plots of the following:
	    - Pressure
	    - Magnitude
	    - Step (optionals)
