-> Identifying type of analysis

	commencing @ 11.15 am BST
	finished   @ ~12.15
	

What I did: 
	   (1) With the given time, focusing only on a 
	       specific step/ID sounds reasonable to do.

	   (2) Given the data that I have, regression
	       could be use to help me in 'prediction' (?)
	       
	   (3) Now, how should one decide the training and
	   	testing data?
