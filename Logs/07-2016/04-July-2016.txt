-> Task: converting the 'xtr file'

	commencing @ ~11.30 am BST
	finished   @ 12.58 am BST
	
What I did: 

	I already converted the xtr file to txt file using the HemeXtract.
	There were some abnormality when viewing the file using wordpad.
	I 'fixed' it and convert that file into a CSV file.
	However, there are some formatting need to be done to fix some
	of the number shown in the column.
	
	Hopefully later in the evening I can do a lot better than this!
	
What to do next:

	(1) Fix the abnormal formatting of the number.
	(2) Practice the Python!!!!!!!!
	
Tool(s) used:

	Only using MS Excel at this stage.
