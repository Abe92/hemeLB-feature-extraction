A cerebral aneurysm (a.k.a intracranial or intracerebral aneurysm) is
a weak or thin spot on a blood vessel in the brain that balloons out
and fills with blood.

The bulging aneurysm can put pressure on a nerve or surrounding brain
tissue. It may also leak or rupture, spilling blood into the surrounding
tissue (called a hemorrhage).

Some cerebral aneurysms, particularly those that are very small, do not
bleed or cause other problems.

CA (cerebral aneurysm) can occur anywhere in the brain, but most are
located along a loop of arteries that run between the underside of the brain
and the base of the skull.

------------------------ Wall Shear Stress ---------------------------

In physics, 'stress' is the internal distribution of forces within a
body that balance and react to the external loads applied to it.

'Strain' is defined as the mechanical deformation of a physical body
under the action of applied forces. Depending on the direction of the
applied force there is a different kind of deformation.

'Shear strain' is defined as the deformation of an object in which 
parallel planes remain parallel but are shifted in a direction parallel
to themselves, as opposed to normal stress or force, which when applied 
to an object induces normal (direct) deformation.

For a one-dimensional object, deformation is either lengthening or shortening.

For a two-dimensional object, there are a total of four strain components:
normal strain along the x or y axis, and shear strain causing distortion of the
shape along the x or y axis.

The 'haemodynamic conditions' inside blood vessels lead to the development
of superficial stresses near the vessel walls, which can be divided into two
categories:

a) 'Circumferential stress' due to pulse pressure variation inside the vessel.

b) 'Shear stress' due to blood flow.

The direction of the shear stress vector is determined by the direction
of the blood flow velocity vector very close to the vessel wall.

Shear stress is applied by the blood against the vessel wall. On the other 
hand, the force applied to the blood by the wall is considered as 'friction'
and has a direction opposite to the blood flow.

'Normal stresses' due to blood pressure are transferred to all vessel 
wall layers *(intima, media and adventitia).

|* 'Intima' is the inner layer abutting the vessel lumen.
|  'Adventitia' is the outer layer abutting the perivascular soft tissue.
|  'Media' is sandwiched between the intima and adventitia.

'Shear stress' is applied mainly to the inner layer of the arterial wall
in contact with the blood, the 'vascular endothelium'.

Computational fluid dynamics (or CFD) has the potential to become a very useful(l)
tool for analysing cerebral aneurysm rupture risk, and thus provide huge benefits
for clinical decision making. 

--------------------------- Below taken from page 4 ----------------------------

CFD enables the simulation of blood flow within 3D vascular geometries, 
based upon patient specific data, allowing values such as 
wall shear stress (WSS) to be calculated and analysed. A large amount of the
work published so far in the field cerebral vasculature CFD has been based upon
studies of small number of vessel geometries. However, to make findings clinically
useful it will be necessary for scientists to work on much larger clinical 
datasets. One study successfully incorporated a large number of patients by 
Cebral et al. However, several shortcomings must also be noted.

------------------------ End of page 4 worthy information ----------------------

------------------------ Below taken from page 5 -------------------------------

Firstly, the use of non-patient specific boundary conditions could well have had
a significant effect upon the accuracy of the simulations. Secondly, there could
be potential issues when translating the categorisation method used to a clinical
setting

------------------------- End of page 5 worthy information ---------------------

Sample size of the extracted parameters seemed to have important roles in the accuracy of the 
simulation but, 'specific boundary conditions used' is the pivotal factor in terms
of the simulation accuracy.

However there is some shortcoming, for instance:

'The patient specific boundary conditions' data (?) are not necessarily 
optimal, because the clinical environment in which the measurements
are taken is not reflective of the situations normally encountered by patients.
(Marzo et al)

The majority of imaging techniques involve the patient lying on their back,
which is not representative of postures adopted throughout the day.

Furthermore, the(y) majority of research involving computational models of
vasculature has so far used data collected from patients at rest.

It is problematic because 
!! 'aneurysm rupture is more likely to occur when a patient is not at rest' !!

The only accessible part of the journal is the abstarct. However, it provides 
an insightful of potential variable of importance. These parametres are

1. Wall Shear Stress,
2. Shear rate,
3. Vorticity, and
4. Viscous dissipation.

There is another parameter that might be useful to take into consideration,
that is the velocity of the bloodflow itself 'rubbing' with the wall of blood vessel.
Including the state of the patients, where being active gives more accuracy rather 
than at the state of resting.

An access to this journal is required to have deeper understanding, but the journal
itself is currently at the state of 'embargo policies'.
