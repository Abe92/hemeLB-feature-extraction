Logbook

-> Task: Project proposal draft

commencing @ 10.30 am
finished   @ 12.30 pm


------------------------- Project Background -----------------------------------

1. Described what is cerebral aneurysm
2. Described the potential use of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) as a tool for
analysisng cerebral aneurysm, including its potential parameter:
				"Wall Shear Stress"
3. Described the shortcoming of the current state data collected (?)

-----------(?) I'm not sure if this is relevant at all with the project------------

What to do next, have a break
Will continue later.


-> Task: Continuation of project proposal draft

commencing @ 17.30
finished   @ 19.29

-------------------------- Project Background -----------------------------------

A cerebral aneurysm (intracranial or intracerebral aneurysm) is a weak or thin spot
on blood vessel in the brain that balloons out and fills with blood. The bulging
aneurysm can put pressure on a nerveor surrounding brain tissue. It may also leak
or rupture spilling blood into the surround tissue (called a haemorrhage). CA (cerebral aneurysm) can occur anywhere in the brain, but most are
located along a loop of arteries that run between the underside of the brain and 
the base of the skull.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has the potential to become a very useful tool
for analysing cerebral anuerysm rupture risk, and thus provide huge benefit for
clinical decision making. CFD enables the simulation of blood flow within 3D
vascular geometries, based upon patient specific data, allowing values such as wall
shear stress (WSS) to be calculated and analysed.

To do next: investigate further about visualisation result (?)

The goal of the project: visualisation tool for better aneurysm visualisation (?)
