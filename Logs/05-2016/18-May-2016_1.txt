-> Task: Continuing project proposal draft

	commencing @ 10.45
	finished   @ 12.37

What is accomplished: 'define the project approach'

--- Approach ---

The above objectives will be achieved through the following activities:

->Purpose: Literature review concerning CFD use in predicting cerebral aneurysm 
rupture.
->Activities: 
Conduct a focused literature review specifically concerned about CFD usage in the field of cerebral aneurysm 
research. A good starting point to gain knowledge of CFD use in cerebral aneurysm research is 
identified through the American Journal of Neuroradiology. This activity should take no more than 2 weeks.
->Output:
Gained an understanding and importance of CFD usage in the CA (cerebral aneurysm) research.
->Anticipated problem(s):
The journal(s) in question is not up to date, between in the range of 1990s to early 2000s.
->Solution(s):
Filter the journal(s) in question to be in the range of 2009 to 2015 the latest.

->Purpose: Investigate the perceptions and attitude towards the currently available tool(s) utilising the 
CFD in the field of CA including its haemodynamic properties.
->Activities:
Conduct an informal interview with the academia researchers in the cerebral aneurysm research field. 
The informal interview should take up to 15 minutes. Gathering this beneficial knowledge is aimed to 
take up to 4 weeks.
->Output:
Obtained the haemodynamic properties used in the CA field including gained an understanding of 
why various haemodynamic properties being consistently shows up in the journal(s).
->Anticipated problem(s):
The academia researcher(s) might be unable to attend the informal interview due to various reason.
->Solution(s):
Create an open-ended questionnaire specifically aimed to the academia researcher which can be 
solve in between 10 - 15 minutes. The approximate time is to allow the researcher to include 
as many as information including their professional and educated view regarding the topic.

Will continue writing after 13.00
