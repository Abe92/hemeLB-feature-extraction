# Test-codes

All Python scripts need to be updated in the future

Notes:

(1) The Python script for _plotting_ with __pandas library__ is safe to use. <br/>
(2) The Python script calculator to calculate __magnitudes__ and __time-steps__ then store the output to text file is 'buggy'at the moment. It will be fix after __15th September 2016__ (Aldy Abe - 13th August 2016) <br/>

Update: 

(1) The Python script calculator to calculate __magnitudes__ and __time-steps__ then store the _output_ to text file is fix. <br/>
    It is now work perfectly. Solved after utilising the Pandas built in.
